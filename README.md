content based filtering
Music Recommender System
A recommender system, also known as a recommendation system or engine, is a filtering system designed to predict a user's preference or rating for an item, such as a film, product, or song.

## Types of Recommender Systems
### Content-based Filters:

Recommends items based on the similarity of their attributes or content
Collaborative Filters:-> Predicts preferences using a matrix with ratings on different items.

Content-based methods are fast and interpretable, leveraging item attributes for recommendations. However, they often lack the surprise element of discovering entirely new items. Collaborative methods, on the other hand, work with interaction matrices, aiming to predict a user's interest in an item.

Project Overview
This project aims to:

## Content-Based Music Recommender System:

Utilizes a dataset of 57,650 English songs, including name, artist, and lyrics, sourced from Kaggle and LyricsFreak.
Implementation: Jupyter Notebook - content_based_music_recommender.ipynb
Data Source: songdata.csv
Collaborative Filtering Music Recommender System:

Uses the Million Song Dataset, a collection of audio features and metadata for a million contemporary popular music tracks.
Implementation: Jupyter Notebook - collaborative_music_recommender.ipynb
Data Source: songs.csv
Repository Structure
Content-Based Recommendation System:

content_based_music_recommender.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis for the content-based recommendation system.
songdata.csv: CSV file containing data for the songs used in the system.
Collaborative Recommendation System:

collaborative_music_recommender.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis for the collaborative recommendation system.
songs.csv: CSV file containing data for the songs used in the system.
How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the respective Jupyter notebooks to explore the implementations and analyses.
